<!--                                                   -->
<!-- Because of this XML's location within the ACS CDB -->
<!-- (i.e., $ACS_CDB/CDB/alma/simulated/.),            -->
<!-- this simulated behavior description is            -->
<!-- tied into the TEST_RPS_1 component and in no way  -->

<!-- There are several things to take note of here:    -->
<!--   1. Everything defined within XML elements       -->
<!--      consists of Python code. You must obey the   -->
<!--      whitespace rules of Python within these.      -->
<!--   2. Not all methods and BACI properties defined  -->
<!--      in IDL for this component are defined here.  -->
<!--      This is unnecessary as the simulator         -->
<!--      framework will dynamically generate methods  -->
<!--      and properties that have not been defined by -->
<!--      some means available to the end-user.        -->
<!--   3. Implementations of inherited methods defined -->
<!--      in other parts of the CDB will be used where -->
<!--      applicable. In this specific case, see       -->
<!--      $ACS_CDB/CDB/alma/simulated/interfaces/alma/ -->
<!--      PS/PowerSupply/1.0 and also $ACS_CDB/CDB/    -->
<!--      alma/simulated/interfaces/alma/RampedPS/     -->
<!--      RampedPowerSupply/1.0                        -->
<!--   4. With respect to 3., one should also note that-->
<!--      it's perfectly acceptable to override methods-->
<!--      defined within $ACS_CDB/CDB/alma/simulated/  -->
<!--      alma/*                                       -->

<!-- All simulated components should be derived from   -->
<!-- the SimulatedComponent XML element.               -->
<!-- Pay close attention to the fact we set the        -->

<!-- we want the simulator to search through other     -->

<!-- of the RampedPowerSupply IDL interface which also -->
