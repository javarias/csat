Threeaxis is a program that simulates the motion of the three axis
telescope mount designed by Tracy Wilson.  The pointing equations were
derived by Steve Joiner.

The following libraries must be installed in order to build the
project:  gtk, opengl, glut, and gtkglext.

To compile the project for Linux, use the standard configure and make
steps.

To compile the projet for Windows, you can use configure and make
under MinGW or Cygwin, although I was never able to get get my
environment configured so that it would work.  I used Dev-C++ instead,
and have provided the project file as threeaxis.dev.
