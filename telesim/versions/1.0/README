Readme file for Telescope Simulator v0.1
Computer Systems Research Group
Universidad Tecnica Federico Santa Maria
Valparaiso, Chile

This program simulates the behavior of some amateur telescopes
through a computer's serial port. It listens for commands on the
first RS232 port (or any other specified port) and sends responses
according to some telescope communication protocol specification.

It is intended to test telescope control systems. For a list of
supported telescopes see the TELESCOPES file.

To use it just go to the 'src' directory and run "make". This should
build the simulator into the 'bin' directory. You can run it with
default options running "./telesim" into that directory. For a list
of supported options run "./telesim --help".

We would really appreciate if can send an email telling us how are
using this software, so we can improve it. Any questions or suggestions
are welcome, too.
