Readme file for Telescope Client v0.1
Computer Systems Research Group
Universidad Tecnica Federico Santa Maria
Valparaiso, Chile

This program communicates with the NexStar 4 SE telescope through the
serial port and give it commands, and some action is triggered.

The program may not be much usefull for general purpouse, but it can be
very usefull at the time to probe the telescope<->PC communication. The
client has been construced following the NexStar Serial Port Communication
Protocol that can be obtained from www.nexstar.com . So, may be other
telescopes that supports most of the commands that this client sends trough
the serial line.

To use it just go to the 'src' directory and run "make". This should
build the telescope clien into the 'bin' directory. You can run it with
default options running "./cli_nex4" into that directory. For a list
of supported options run "./cli_nex4 --help".

We would really appreciate if can send an email telling us how are
using this software, so we can improve it. Any questions or suggestions
are welcome, too.
